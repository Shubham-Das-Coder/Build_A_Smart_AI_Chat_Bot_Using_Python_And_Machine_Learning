units.', 'Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine.', 'Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by damaging these filtering units and collecting tubules and causing scarring.', \"Polycystic kidney Open pop-up dialog box Close Polycystic kidney Polycystic kidney A healthy kidney (left) eliminates waste from the blood and maintains the body's chemical balance.\", 'With polycystic kidney disease (right), fluid-filled sacs called cysts develop in the kidneys.', 'The kidneys grow larger and gradually lose the ability to function as they should.', 'Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.', \"Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:\\n\\nType 1 or type 2 diabetes\\n\\nHigh blood pressure\\n\\nGlomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)\\n\\nInterstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures\\n\\nPolycystic kidney disease or other inherited kidney diseases\\n\\nProlonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers\\n\\nVesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys\\n\\nRecurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis)\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nFactors that can increase your risk of
